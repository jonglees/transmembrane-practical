You have been tasked with predicting all cell surface transmembrane proteins for a cancer therapeutic company https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/targeted-cancer-drugs-immunotherapy/car-t-cell-therapy. The company does not want you to use public ML websites to predict cell surface proteins so you have to build your own...good luck!

The code to get you started is here: https://github.com/jonglees/transmembrane-practical/blob/main/practical_transmem_ML_datasets.ipynb
